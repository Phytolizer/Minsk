# Contributing

Welcome to the Minsk repository! To contribute, you may work on an existing implementation or create one of your own.

## Rules

- Language implementations go in the folder corresponding to their primary file extension
  (e.g. `cs` for C#, `rs` for Rust, and `cpp` for C++).
  - If there are multiple implementations in the same language (in the future), they would be
    suffixed with an integer to distinguish them (e.g. `cpp2`, `cpp3`, ...)
- Commits are to be frequent and small in size (with few exceptions):
  - New language implementations are exempt from this rule and may be squashed into one commit.
  - Rationale: Code review is time consuming when commits are large and unfocused.
